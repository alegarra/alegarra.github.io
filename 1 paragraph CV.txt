AL has a long experience in quantitative genetics and animal breeding in Spain, the US and France. He started his career in research applied to genetic evaluations and selection schemes in dairy sheep and beef cattle, using innovative approaches. In the last ten years he has been very involved in the introduction of genomic evaluation and selection, including the very first use of cross validation to check genomic predictions (in mice, with more than 100 citations) and the generation of genomic data and use in dairy sheep. Within a large network of collaborators, he actively develops the Single Step GBLUP method, which is becoming the standard in genomic prediction, in a series of papers widely cited. Lately he has been working in extensions of (Single Step) GBLUP to crosses, dominance and epistasis.
